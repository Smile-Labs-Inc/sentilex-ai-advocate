  "summary": "Metadata & Content Package (MCP) analysis of four Sri Lankan legislative instruments completed. Dataset comprises Online Safety Act (2024), Personal Data Protection Act (2022), Computer Crime Act (2007), and Children/Young Persons Amendment Act (2022). Total of 146 legal clauses identified and normalized; 51 definitions extracted; 4 documents with hierarchical structure mapping. Cross-file consistency issues noted regarding age definitions and external references. All documents suitable for ingestion into Antigravity pipeline with recommended preprocessing steps.",

    "WARN-004: Children Amendment Act is amendment-only; principal enactment (Chapter 23) not provided - full applicability map cannot be verified without source document",
    "WARN-002: PDPA extensively references Schedules I-V; complete schedules must be available for full compliance mapping and data processing condition validation",
    "WARN-005: Age definition critical inconsistency: Chapter 23 amended from 16 to 18 years - must verify if other legislation (e.g., Penal Code references) updated correspondingly",
    "WARN-001: Online Safety Act contains extensive Schedule references; definitions only partially provided in raw content",
    "WARN-008: Typo detected: 'sccure' in Computer Crime Act Explanation 2 (should be 'secure') - recommend OCR/validation review",
    "WARN-009: PDPA Sections 29-31 mentioned but minimal content; full sections recommended for completeness",
    "WARN-003: Computer Crime Act references external legislation (Code of Criminal Procedure Act 1979) not provided; cross-link validation required",

    "Step 1: Obtain complete Schedules (I-V) for Online Safety Act and Personal Data Protection Act for full annotation",

    "Step 4: Validate age threshold consistency across all laws post-Amendment Act; update any downstream references",
    "Step 5: Perform OCR correction on flagged typos (e.g., 'sccure' → 'secure') and validate against official Gazette versions",
    "Step 6: Cross-reference Online Safety Act prohibition types (sections 12-20) with Penal Code equivalents (286A, 288, 360A, 363, etc.) for harmonization",
    "Step 7: Generate definition reconciliation map - consolidate 14 key terms (child, personal data, online location, etc.) with variations across documents",
    "Step 8: Execute chunking pipeline (heading-aware, 512 tokens, 50-token overlap) and generate embeddings using text-embedding-3-large",
    "Step 9: Validate all internal Schedule references and section cross-references for integrity",
    "Step 10: Prepare for Antigravity ingestion: ensure all chunk metadata includes source provenance, legal construct type, and confidence scores"
