# Sri Lankan Legal Framework (2026)

In the Sri Lankan legal context of 2026, problems related to children (under 18), young people, and women are categorized by the Penal Code, the Online Safety Act, and protective ordinances.

Here are the primary problem categories and the specific legal issues they cover:

## 1. Crimes Against Children (Under 18)

This category focuses on the protection of minors and is primarily governed by the Penal Code and the Children and Young Persons Ordinance (CYPO).

- **Cruelty & Physical Abuse**: Willful assault, ill-treatment, neglect, or abandonment that causes suffering or health injury.
- **Sexual Exploitation**: Procuring children for sex, inducing them into sexual activities, or allowing them to remain in premises for abuse.
- **Statutory Rape**: Sexual intercourse with a child under 16, regardless of consent.
- **Indecent Publications**: Using children in obscene exhibitions, shows, or pornography.
- **Forced Labor & Criminal Exploitation**: Hiring children for begging or for transporting illegal goods like drugs and weapons.
- **School Bullying & Corporal Punishment**: Now recognized as punishable offenses following 2024–2025 reforms to end all forms of corporal punishment.

## 2. Violence Against Women & Gender-Based Violence (GBV)

These categories address physical, psychological, and institutional violence specifically targeting women.

- **Sexual Harassment**: Unwelcome sexual advances, unwanted comments, or display of pornography in public, private, or educational settings (Section 345).
- **Domestic Violence**: Physical or psychological harm within a domestic relationship, regulated by the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act.
- **Grave Sexual Abuse**: Non-consensual sexual acts that do not meet the definition of rape but carry heavy penalties (Section 365B).
- **Trafficking**: Forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation.
- **Intimidation & Stalking**: Verbal or physical threats intended to cause alarm or distress.

## 3. Digital & Online Safety (Youth & Women)

A major category for the Sentilex project, governed by the Online Safety Act No. 9 of 2024.

- **Online Harassment**: Publishing private information (images, videos, or contact details) with the intent to cause distress or allow others to harass the target.
- **Cyber Stalking**: Persistent unwanted digital contact or monitoring.
- **Online Cheating & Personation**: Deceiving victims via fake accounts to fraudulently obtain property or cause harm to reputation.
- **Non-Consensual Intimate Image Sharing**: "Revenge porn" or sharing private images a person reasonably expects to remain private.

## 4. Juvenile Justice & Rights

Concerns for "Young People" (those aged 18–22) and their transition into adulthood.

- **Rehabilitative Justice**: Transitioning from punitive measures to age-appropriate rehabilitation for offenders under 22.
- **Access to Justice**: Problems involving a lack of legal representation or inability to pay fines for minor offenses.
- **Education & Employment Deficits**: Systematic lack of access to schooling or vocational training, which is linked to increased risk of juvenile offending.
